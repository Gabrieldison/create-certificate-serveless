# Create certificate serveless

## About

Project developed in the last module of the NodeJS trail in Rocketseat's Ignite bootcamp. The idea was to build a serverless application to generate course certificates.
## Ignite Certificate

Ignite Certificate is a serverless application for issuing course completion certificates.

Built during the last module of the NodeJS track, this serverless project issues certificates based on a created template, transforms it into a PDF and uploads it to S3 so that the user can download it.
In addition to issuing, the application also has a function for validating certificates. Below is an example of a certificate issued by the application:
